### 1.4. Learning Outcomes

The learning outcomes covered are listed on the [Learning Outcomes page](outcomes) of our course website.



----------------


## 2. Course Activities

### 2.1. Calendar 

The course calendar is listed on the [Weekly Calendar section](week/index) of our course website. We summarize a few important dates below.

#### 2.1.1. Important Assessment Dates

- **Preparation** tasks due before each lecture time
- **Participation** activities will be due during each class time.

---

- **Homework** assignments due every scheduled class day at 11:59pm ET.
- **Checkpoint Exams** will be given during most class days.

---

- **Midterm Exam 1:** Thursday, June 15th, during our scheduled lecture time.
- **Midterm Exam 2:** Thursday, July 6th, during our scheduled lecture time.



#### 2.1.2. Other Important Dates

- **Last Day to Drop/Add:** Thursday, June 1st
- **Last Day to Resign:** Monday, June 26th
- **Last Day of Class:** Thursday, July 6th
- **Final Grades Posted:** Friday, July 14th



### 2.2. Lecture

We will be using a "semi-flipped" classroom model. This essentially means that you will be responsible for completing a preparation lesson video and reading before each scheduled lecture time, and then we will be using class to complete various graded assessments (in-class assignments, checkpoint exams, etc) as well as some traditional direct instruction.

The motivation for using this approach is that you will be engaged in active learning activities while the professor is present. This way you can ask questions!


### 2.3. Recitations

The recitation time will be a reserved block of time during which you complete the preparation videos for that day. 


### 2.4. Office Hours

Office hours will be conducted through our course UB Learns Q&A Help Forum. You can use this help forum to ask Prof. Casper any questions about the course.



----------------


## 3. Assessments

Your final grade will be determined by your performance on the following categories: Learning Checks, Participation, and Midterm Exams.

### 3.1. Learning Checks (45%)


Each learning outcome will directly be assessed by a Learning Check. In order to receive a Learning Check for a particular learning outcome you need to receive **all** of the following:

- 95% or higher on the applicable **Homework Set**
- M (Meets Expectations) on **_one_** applicable **Checkpoint Exam** Question


Your final score for this grading category will then be calculated as the percentage of total possible Learning Checks you earn. 

> **Both** conditions listed above must be satisfied to earn your Learning Check for each individual learning outcome. You will not receive any credit for only completing one of these conditions. (Keep in mind that you are allowed 2 Homework Passes.)


#### 3.1.1. Homework

There will be one Homework Assignment assigned for each learning outcome. Each set will be due at&nbsp;11:59pm ET on the day posted on WeBWorK. 

You must earn a score of 95% or better to ultimately earn credit for each Homework Set.


> You are allowed **2 Homework Passes.** Each individual Homework Pass grants you a score of 100% on 1 Homework Set. These will automatically be applied at the end of the semester, in whichever configuration gives you the highest final average.

<!--

#### 3.1.2. Homework Notebook Check

You will submit a paper copy of your Homework Notebook containing your written solutions to the HW problems from WeBWorK.


Your notebook for each learning outcome will be graded as either: (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing. The criteria we will be looking for are: number of solutions, neatness, and level of detail.

- **(M) Meets Expectations** means the notebook contains a sufficient number of solutions, is neatly written and presented, and matches the level of detail as described in the lecture examples.
- **(P) Progressing** means your notebook contains either an insufficient number of solutions, is not neatly written, or the solutions do not meet the level of detail given in the lecture examples. 



> You are allowed **2 Notebook Check Passes.** Each individual Notebook Check Pass grants you a score of (M) Meets Expectations on 1 Notebook Check. These will automatically be applied at the end of the semester, in whichever configuration gives you the highest final average.


**What to Include?**

Your written solutions for each problem, should be modeled after the solutions we do during class or in the lesson videos. Essentially, the work from class is what we want to see from you on both the homework and the exams. Additionally, to help make these notebooks a good study resource for you later on in the course, we also want to see that you:

1. Leave enough space in between problems. (Having your work crammed together makes it very difficult for you to read.) 
2. Write as neat as possible. (You will want to be able to read this again later in the semester.)
3. Use two columns for your notebook; questions in the first column, your solutions in the second column.
4. Use loose-leaf paper (do not tear the pages out of a spiral notebook).

-->


#### 3.1.2. Checkpoint Exams

Each day, a Checkpoint Exam will be given during our scheduled lecture time. These Checkpoint Exams will test, on average, 2-4 of the learning outcomes. 

The questions asked on these exams will be very similar in format to the in-class examples as well as the WeBWorK Homework Sets. Each question is designed to assess your understanding of one particular course learning outcome. Your response for each question will be graded as one of three possibilities: (M) Meets Expectations, (P) Progressing, or (U) Unsatisfactory. 

The Checkpoint Exam grading is described in more detail in the Grading section, but in general you will have multiple opportunities (attempts) to earn full credit on these questions.

<!--
#### 3.1.4. Preparation

Each content-based learning outcome will have a small preparation assignment designed to verify your completion of the necessary readings and videos in time for class.

Each preparation assignment will be graded as either (S) Satisfactory or (U) Unsatisfactory.

- You will earn 2 learning checks if you successfully earn Satisfactory on 90% of the preparation assignments.

- You will earn 1 learning check if you successfully earn Satisfactory on 80% of the preparation assignments but less than 90%.  
-->
### 3.2 Participation (15%)

Attendance and participation at each lecture section will be graded through in-class participation problems. Your grade for this category will be calculated as the percentage of (M) Meets Expectations scores you earn on the combined total of participation problems.

Each problem will be graded as either (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing. These participation problems are an early part of the learning process, so you will not necessarily be graded on full comprehension. Instead, you will usually be graded based on whether an honest attempt to answer the question(s) was made (using your notes from class and the preparation materials).

- **(M) Meets Expectations** indicates an honest attempt was made on your part to solve the problem(s) using your notes from class and preparation material.
- **(P) Progressing** means your work is insufficient based on what was presented in class and the preparation material up to that point.


> Everyone gets **6 Participation Passes** for the session. Each individual pass grants you a score of (M) Meets Expectations on 1 in-class participation problem. 
>
> - If you are absent one day, then a participation pass will be applied for each problem you missed.
> - Most days, we will complete more than 1 participation problem.

<!--

#### 3.2.1. In-Class Assignments

During most classes we will have in-class activities that we will work on as a class either all together, individually, or in small groups. These activities will be turned in during class time.  



Each in-class activity will be graded as either (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing. These in-class assignments are an early part of the learning process, so you will not necessarily be graded on full comprehension. Instead, you will usually be graded based on whether an honest attempt to answer the question(s) was made (using your notes from class and the preparation materials).

- **(M) Meets Expectations** indicates an honest attempt was made on your part to solve the problem(s) using your notes from class and preparation material.
- **(P) Progressing** means your work is insufficient based on what was presented in class and preparation material up to that point.



#### 3.1.5. Peer Evaluation

We will also have a weekly in-class peer evaluation assignment. With the guidance of the instructor or TA, you will be grading a small selection of your classmates' checkpoint exams. Don't worry, your exams will still be graded by the course staff (instructor, TA, or graders). But these peer evaluation assignments are meant to accomplish a few things:

- Help you understand what we are looking for in a successful solution, so that you can make improvements for any future attempts of your own.
- Critically reading over someone else's work and providing helpful feedback also helps reinforce your own understanding of the material.  

Each peer evaluation will be graded as either (M) Meets Expectations or (P) Progressing based on whether you accurately provide helpful (and respectful) feedback on each exam assigned to you. This feedback could be comments about something you like in their work, something they could improve for next time, or maybe an explanation for why a particular step is incorrect and needs to be improved for next time. 

- **(M) Meets Expectations** indicates that you wrote down the correct solution for the peer student and provided helpful and respectful comments.
- **(P) Progressing** means your peer evaluation is either missing the correct solution or is missing comments and feedback.

-->

### 3.3. Midterm Exams (40%)

There are two midterm exams given during our scheduled lecture time on the dates listed in the [Weekly Calendar section](week/index). These are class exams using a traditional grading scheme, with partial credit where applicable. 

- Your highest midterm exam score will be worth 25% of your final grade.
- Your lowest midterm exam score will be worth 15% of your final grade.



### 3.3. Final Exam

There is not a cumulative final exam for this course.

<!--

There is one cumulative final exam given during Finals Week on the date listed in the [Weekly Calendar section](week/index) (and also on your HUB Student Center). This is a department exam using a traditional grading scheme, with partial credit where applicable. 

_Technical information about how the exam will be delivered and proctored will be sent out several weeks before the final._

## 4. Course Grading


### 4.1. Final Average

Your final average will be found by averaging your scores using the following weights:

| Assessment  | Weight |
|:------------:|:------:|
| Learning Checks      | 45%  |
| Participation        | 15%  |
| Highest Midterm Exam | 25%  |
| Lowest Midterm Exam  | 15%  |

### 4.2. Letter Grade

Your final letter grade will be determined from your final average by applying the cutoffs below.

**Note:** Final Averages will only be rounded (up or down) to the nearest tenth.

| Final Average ($x$)| Letter Grade |
|:------------:|:------:|
| $93 \leq x \leq 100$      | A     |
| $90 \leq x < 93$          | A-    |
| $87 \leq x < 90$          | B+    | 
| $83 \leq x < 87$          | B     |
| $80 \leq x < 83$          | B-    |
| $77 \leq x < 80$          | C+    |
| $73 \leq x < 77$          | C     |
| $70 \leq x < 73$          | C-    |
| $67 \leq x < 70$          | D+    |
| $60 \leq x < 67$          | D     |
| $0  \leq x < 60$          | F     | 

An incomplete grade (I) will only be given out as per the university undergraduate [Incomplete Policy.](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/explanation.html)

### 4.3 Calculating Your Grade

Calculate your Learning Check score.
  1. Count how many learning checks you earned.
  2. Divide this by the total number of possible learning checks.
  3. Multiply this by 100.

Calculate your Final Average
  1. Multiply your Learning Check score by 0.45
  2. Multiply your Participation score by 0.15
  3. Multiply your Highest Midterm Exam score by 0.25
  5. Multiply your Lowest Midterm Exam score by 0.15
  7. Add these four values together, this is your Final Average.


  

### 4.4. Exam Grading


**Midterm Exam** questions will be graded using a traditional partial credit grading scheme. 

**Checkpoint Exam** questions will **not** be graded using a traditional partial credit grading scheme.  Instead, each question will be graded as one of three possibilities:


|Grade  | Name | Description | Additional Attempt? |
|:------------:|------|------|---------------------|
| M     | Meets Expectations    | Congratulations! You've successfully demonstrated your understanding of this learning outcome. This means you have shown sufficient work, used correct notation, and ultimately arrived at the correct answer. There may be a few minor errors in your work as long as they do not detract from your overall response. | No need. You do not need to try this learning outcome on any of the remaining checkpoint exams. |
| P     | Progressing    | Keep going! You are making progress on this learning outcome, but still need a little more work to show your understanding. | Yes. You will be able to attempt this learning outcome again for full credit. |
| U     | Unsatisfactory    | You have made only minimal progress on mastering this learning outcome, or had an unexcused absence from this exam. | No. You will not be able to attempt this learning outcome again for full credit. |

**Additional Attempts**: Each Checkpoint Exam question can be attempted at least twice for full credit as long as you keep scoring (P) Progressing each time.
- The first attempt is during the lecture Checkpoint Exam.
- The second attempt is during the next Checkpoint Exam.
- Additionally, any Midterm Exam question that tests the same learning outcome may also be used as an additional attempt (at the discretion of the instructor). 

All together this means that you potentially have 3 opportunities to earn full credit on a majority of the Checkpoint Exam questions.


> **Frequently Asked Questions**
> 
> _Will my final average be affected if I achieve (P) Progressing on the first attempt, but do achieve (M) on a later attempt?_ 
> - No, there is no reduction in your final average in this case.
> 
> _Do I need to complete all questions on a Checkpoint Exam?_
> - Not necessarily. You only need to complete those questions on which you originally earned a score of P (Progressing). If you originally scored M (Meets Expectations), you do not need to complete that problem again.

You are expected to complete this preparation material in its entirety before your scheduled class time. This is to ensure that you are ready to participate with all class time work that day.

- **Lecture Attendance:** Attendance is mandatory at every scheduled lecture time as we will be completing graded assessments during each scheduled meeting.




<!--
#### 5.2.2. Attendance and Participation Policy Rider

The instructor reserves the right to make attendance and participation at the guided homework sessions and recitations a mandatory requirement for any student whose progress in the course drops to a C- or below at any point during the semester. You will receive an email notification from the instructor if this happens to you.

These additional requirements must then be met in order for you to take any applicable exams. In the event that you do not meet the requirements as stated in the email notification, you will automatically receive a grade of 0 for that exam. The email notification will explicitly list all additional requirements and applicable exams.
-->

<!--
#### 5.2.2. Electronic Device Policy 

While electronic devices can be a very helpful tool, they can also be an incredible distraction, significantly slowing the learning process. To this end, all electronic devices should be silenced and physically put away during every lecture and recitation. This means all phones, computers, and tablets* should not be brought out during class unless directed by the instructor to do so.


**Every violation of this policy will result in a grade of 0 for that day's participation assessment(s).**

- You may use a tablet during class, if you are using it to take handwritten notes.

-->

#### 5.2.3. Email and Communication Policy

It is required that your university (buffalo.edu) email address be used for all official course email correspondence.


> Any questions related to the course that are not of a personal nature should be asked on the Help Forum or during Class Time. <!--Response times are significantly faster on these platforms.-->


While we encourage everyone to ask questions about the course, email will have the slowest response time and should only be used for personal matters.  Please allow 24 hours during the work week for a response from the instructor. Email responses will only be sent out M-F during normal business hours 9am-5pm ET.  Do  not expect a response outside of these times.

- Consult the syllabus before sending an email about course policy or grading, usually the answer is already in the syllabus. 
- Emails requesting a make-up exam should clearly explain the reason for the request and provide proper documentation.
- Emails requesting an individual homework extension will not be returned. See the course Late Policy as to why. 



### 5.3. Grading Policies

#### 5.3.1. Curve Policy

All grades are calculated as described in this syllabus. **There is not a curve in this course.**  All assessments are designed to assess your individual understanding of the learning outcomes. **Your grade is completely within *your control* and based solely on *your performance*.**

#### 5.3.2. Exception Policy

Requests for individual exceptions to any policy or grading assessment described in this syllabus will not be granted. This is to ensure that all students are given equal opportunity to succeed in this class and are all graded by the same set of standards.

#### 5.3.3. Late Policy

All assignments (homework, preparation, participation, etc) are due by the posted date and time.  Late submissions will not be accepted for any reason.

There is some flexibility already built into the course grading to allow for a couple of missed assignments.

> Please take some time at the beginning of the semester to make sure that you do not have any conflicts with our class schedule. All non-emergency requests for a make-up exam must be submitted by the Add/Drop deadline.


Make-up exams will only be given in the event of an emergency situation (severe illness), religious holiday, or conflict with a university sport.

In addition to a compelling and serious reason, all make-up exam requests must meet the following requirements:

**Supporting Documentation:** All requests for a make-up exam must provide supporting documentation of the situation at the time of the request. If you do not provide such documentation, your make-up exam request will be denied.

**Timeliness** 
- **For non-emergency reasons**, all make-up exam requests must be submitted to the Instructor at the beginning of the semester before the end of the Add/Drop period. All requests submitted after this deadline will be denied.
- **For emergency reasons**, all make-up exam requests must be submitted to the Instructor no later than 24 hours after the exam. All requests submitted after this deadline will be denied.
- If a make-up exam request is approved, the student is expected to complete the make-up exam at the time scheduled by the instructor. This will usually be at the end of the semester after Final Exams. 


<!--
Additionally, since Midterm Exams 1 and 2 are being conducted outside of our regular class time, you should double check these times for any work conflicts.

**Employment:** Students who are currently employed and have a conflict between their work schedule and either Midterm Exam 1 or 2, should first make a good faith effort to rearrange their work schedule so they can attend the Midterm Exam as scheduled. If the student is unable to rearrange their schedule in order to take the Midterm Exam, the student should contact the Instructor no less than 7 calendar days before the exam date. **Note that this only applies to Midterm Exams 1 and 2, since these exams are being given outside of our scheduled class time.** A work conflict request will be denied for any exams given during our regularly scheduled class time or allocated final exam time.
