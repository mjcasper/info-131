```{admonition} One More Checkpoint Exam
:class: tip

- **When?** Friday, May 12th during your scheduled lecture time.
- **How Long Is It?** It will be 50 minutes. This means time might be a limiting factor, so you should start with your strongest topic.
- **What Questions?** You can retry any question listed as either **_(P)-Progressing_** or **(U)-Unsatisfactory** on your Week 14 Progress Report.
- **Do I need to take this?** Everyone needs to take this exam, as there will be 1 question of new material. However, the remainder of the exam will only contain older questions that you still need to earn (M)-Meets Expectations on.


```
