## How To Study

The more problems you do, the better prepared you will be!

- **Checkpoint Exams** - If one of your questions was marked incorrect, make sure you understand why. Go through your notes on the solution that was presented during recitation, or use the review videos to find a similar example, and compare what we did there vs what you had on your exam.

- **Old Homework Problems** on WeBWork

- **In-Class Problems** - try the in-class problems we did in lecture. You can also try the preparation problems as well.

- **Lecture Examples** - try the examples we did in lecture: work on them by yourself and then use your notes or the review video to check your solution (not just your answer) or for help if you get stuck.
